My name is Nick. I'm a software developer working that enjoys making games. Currently living in Berlin, Germany.

This website is a CV, showcase, and workbench. I previously built it from scratch. Later I switched to a self-hosted [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) instance. Now it uses [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) ([repo](https://github.com/nicholas-robson/dkydev)).

The name **dkydev** comes from my old online pseudonym "ducky" and an abbreviation of "development". And I like the allusion to [duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) and [duck typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing).

I develop casual games in HTML5 and Unity. I work on indie/core games in my spare time.

Besides gamedev I enjoy badminton, climbing, and working out: plenty of physical exercise to offset the excessive periods of sitting. I also **play** games from time to time.

I also have minor obsession with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>. Here's my first:

A lightweight one after moving to Berlin:
