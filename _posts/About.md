## What is this website?
This website is a my CV, showcase, and workbench. This website was previously built from scratch, then switched to a [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) instance on EC2, and now a using a [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) with S3/Cloudfront and a public git repo.

I also designed the logo :)

## What is dkydev?
**dkydev** comes from my old online pseudonym "ducky" and an abbreviation of "development". I also appreciate the allusion to [duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) and [duck typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing).

## You make games?
I develop casual games for a living. I also make indie/core games in my spare time. Lately been spending a lot of time in Unity and Blender.

## What else do you do?
Some climbing, running, and working out; lot's of physical activity to counter-balance the excessive periods of sitting. I also **play** games from time to time.

I also have minor obsession with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>. Here's my old one:
